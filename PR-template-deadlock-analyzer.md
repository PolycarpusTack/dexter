# Enhanced PostgreSQL Deadlock Analyzer Implementation

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive enhancement to the PostgreSQL Deadlock Analyzer in Dexter, providing better parsing, visualization, and recommendations for deadlock errors captured by Sentry.

## Features

### Backend Enhancements

- **Improved Deadlock Parser:**
  - Transition from regex-heavy parsing to a more structured approach
  - Added query fingerprinting to identify similar queries
  - Implemented a lock compatibility matrix for better conflict analysis
  - Added PII redaction for SQL queries to protect sensitive data
  - Created severity scoring to prioritize critical deadlocks
  - Enhanced error handling with better context

- **Enhanced API Endpoints:**
  - Created new `/enhanced-analyzers` endpoint with backward compatibility
  - Added `/lock-compatibility-matrix` reference endpoint
  - Added placeholder for `/deadlock-history` for future implementation

### Frontend Enhancements

- **Interactive Visualization:**
  - Improved D3.js visualization with multiple layout options
  - Added physics-based simulation with adjustable parameters
  - Created detailed tooltips with comprehensive information
  - Implemented export to SVG functionality
  - Added visual indicators for deadlock severity

- **User Experience Improvements:**
  - Added filtering options (show cycles only, hide tables)
  - Added severity indicators with detailed explanations
  - Implemented copy-to-clipboard for recommendations
  - Added execution metadata display

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows a modular approach:

1. **Enhanced Parser Module:**
   - Created new `enhanced_deadlock_parser.py` with structured models
   - Used best practices for performance optimization
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling

2. **API Router:**
   - Created `enhanced_analyzers.py` router with new endpoints
   - Maintained backward compatibility with original endpoint

3. **Frontend Components:**
   - Implemented `EnhancedGraphView.jsx` for interactive visualization
   - Created `EnhancedDeadlockDisplay.jsx` as a container component
   - Added `enhancedDeadlockApi.js` for API communication

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with various deadlock scenarios:

- Simple two-process deadlocks
- Complex multi-process deadlocks
- Edge cases with unusual lock types
- Performance testing with large deadlock messages

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is provided in:
- `README-Deadlock-Analyzer.md` - Overview and usage instructions
- Code comments throughout the implementation

## Screenshots

| Feature | Screenshot |
|---------|------------|
| Enhanced Graph View | [Insert screenshot here] |
| Lock Details | [Insert screenshot here] |
| Recommendations | [Insert screenshot here] |

## Future Work

- Implement deadlock history and trend analysis
- Add machine learning for pattern recognition
- Integrate with more database systems (MySQL, Oracle)

## Breaking Changes

None. The enhanced implementation is available through new endpoints and components while maintaining backward compatibility.
