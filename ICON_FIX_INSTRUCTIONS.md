# Icon Library Fix Instructions

## Issue
The build is failing because the code was using `lucide-react` icons which weren't installed.

## Solution
I've updated all icon imports to use `@tabler/icons-react` which is already installed in the project.

### Changed Icons:
- `CheckCircle` → `IconCircleCheck`
- `AlertCircle` → `IconAlertCircle`

### Files Updated:
1. `/frontend/src/components/EventTable/EventTable.tsx`
   - Changed `AlertCircle` from `lucide-react` to `IconAlertCircle` from `@tabler/icons-react`

2. `/frontend/src/pages/TestConfigPage.tsx`
   - Changed `CheckCircle` to `IconCircleCheck`
   - Changed `AlertCircle` to `IconAlertCircle`
   - All imports now use `@tabler/icons-react`

## Build Command
You can now run the build without issues:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Alternative Solution
If you prefer to use lucide-react icons, you can install it by running:
```bash
# From the frontend directory
npm install lucide-react --save
```

But the current solution using Tabler icons is recommended since it's already part of the project dependencies.
