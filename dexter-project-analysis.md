## Example Component Analysis: DeadlockModal.tsx

The `DeadlockModal.tsx` component is a good example of the project's architecture and coding standards:

```typescript
const DeadlockModal: React.FC<DeadlockModalProps> = ({ 
  eventId, 
  eventDetails, 
  isOpen, 
  onClose 
}) => {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<string>('graph');
  const [fullScreen, setFullScreen] = useState<boolean>(false);
  const [rawViewOpen, { toggle: toggleRawView }] = useDisclosure(false);
  const [useEnhancedAnalysis, setUseEnhancedAnalysis] = useState<boolean>(true);
  
  // Custom hooks
  const { isCopied, copyToClipboard } = useClipboard();
  const { isMasked, toggleMasking, maskText } = useDataMasking({ defaultMasked: true });
  const logEvent = useAuditLog('DeadlockModal');
  
  // API integration with React Query
  const { 
    data: deadlockData,
    isLoading,
    isError,
    error,
    refetch
  } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['deadlockAnalysis', uniqueId, useEnhancedAnalysis], 
    queryFn: async () => {
      const response = await analyzeDeadlock(eventId, { 
        useEnhancedAnalysis,
        apiPath: useEnhancedAnalysis ? 'enhanced-analyzers' : 'analyzers'
      });
      
      // Validate the response with Zod schema
      return safeValidateDeadlockAnalysisResponse(response);
    },
    enabled: !!uniqueId && isOpen,
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
  });
  
  // Rest of component implementation...
}
```
