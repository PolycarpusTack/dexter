- **Interaction Model**: Zoom, pan, filtering, and layout controls
- **Analysis Features**: Cycle detection, table relationship visualization

### 3. Event Detail Enhancement (100%)

- **Event Details View**: Comprehensive information display
- **Visualization**: Impact metrics and frequency trends
- **Context Information**: User context, environment, and related data

### 4. LLM Integration (100%)

- **Multi-model Support**: ModelSelector component for switching between models
- **Context-aware Prompting**: Enhanced prompt templates for different error types
- **AI Settings**: Configuration UI for managing AI model preferences

### 5. Keyboard Navigation (100%)

- **Table Navigation**: Arrow key navigation with visual focus indicators
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Comprehensive shortcut system with documentation
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, focus management, and screen reader support
- **Shortcut Guide**: Interactive keyboard shortcut guide accessible via `?` key

### 6. UI Polish (100%)

- **Consistent Styling**: Unified design language using Mantine components
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts that work across different screen sizes
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for loading, selection, and focus states
- **Error States**: Well-designed error presentations with recovery options

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Build Configuration

- Added TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json, tsconfig.node.json)
- Updated Vite configuration for TypeScript support
- Enhanced package.json with TypeScript dependencies and scripts
- Fixed build issues related to TypeScript migration

### 2. Code Organization

- Structured components into logical directories
- Separated concerns between different features
- Maintained backward compatibility during migration
- Properly archived original JavaScript files

### 3. Documentation

- Added keyboard shortcuts documentation
- Created implementation guides
- Documented TypeScript interfaces and types
- Added accessibility information

## Current Status

Phase 1 is now 100% complete, with all planned features implemented and properly migrated to TypeScript. The application now provides:

1. A robust error monitoring platform with AI-powered analysis
2. Specialized visualization for PostgreSQL deadlocks
3. Enhanced user experience with keyboard navigation
4. Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. A solid foundation for Phase 2 development

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the focus now shifts to Phase 2 (Enhanced Triage Features), which includes:

1. **Smart Grouping & Aggregation**
   - Automatic grouping of similar stack traces
   - Clustering issues by root cause patterns
   - Tag aggregation with dynamic filtering

2. **AI-Powered Insights**
   - Auto-generated issue summaries
   - Similar issues recommendations
   - Automatic duplicate detection

3. **Visual Decision Indicators**
   - Event frequency sparklines (already partially implemented)
   - User impact heatmaps
   - Regression markers with version comparison

4. **Enhanced Interaction Model**
   - Multi-select bulk actions
   - Drag-and-drop priority sorting
   - Right-click context menu for common operations

## Conclusion

The successful completion of Phase 1 provides a solid foundation for the Dexter project. The TypeScript migration enhances code quality and maintainability, while the implemented features significantly improve the developer experience for error monitoring and analysis.

The implementation closely follows the design document, with all required components successfully implemented and ready for use. The focus on accessibility and keyboard navigation ensures that the application is usable by all developers, regardless of their preferred interaction method.

The project is well-positioned to move forward to Phase 2, building upon the solid foundation established in Phase 1.
