# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Dexter is an intelligent companion tool designed to enhance Sentry.io experience. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore Sentry issues, leverage AI for error explanations, and perform enhanced error analysis.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js (LTS version)
- Poetry (Python dependency manager)
- Ollama (for AI features)
- Sentry account with API token

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
# Option 1: Using fix_dependencies.bat (recommended for Windows)
fix_dependencies.bat

# Option 2: Using Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install poetry
poetry install
# Copy example env file and edit with your Sentry API token
cp .env.example .env
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Common Development Commands

### Backend Commands
```bash
# Run the backend server
cd backend
poetry shell
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Run with specific mode
set APP_MODE=debug && python -m app.main
set APP_MODE=minimal && python -m app.main
set APP_MODE=enhanced && python -m app.main
set APP_MODE=simplified && python -m app.main

# Python 3.13 Compatibility
# If using Python 3.13, run the compatibility script first:
cd backend
python fix_pydantic_compatibility.py
# Or use fix_dependencies.bat which will run it automatically

# Run tests
pytest
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
pytest tests/routers/test_events.py  # Run specific test file
pytest tests/integration/ -m integration  # Run integration tests
pytest tests/benchmarks/ -m slow  # Run performance benchmarks

# Code quality

# Development server
cd frontend
npm run dev  # Starts server at http://localhost:5173

# Typecheck and lint
npm run typecheck
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

```

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- Built with FastAPI
- Domain-driven design with clear separation between:
  - Routers (API endpoints)
  - Services (Business logic)
  - Models (Data structures)
  - Utils (Helper functions)
- Multiple configurable modes (debug, minimal, enhanced, simplified)
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Integration with Sentry and Ollama APIs

### Frontend Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Component architecture:
  - UI components (reusable UI elements)
  - Feature components (specific features like EventTable, DeadlockDisplay)
  - Layout components
- State management:
  - Zustand for global UI state
  - React Query for server state and data fetching
- Error handling with ErrorBoundary components
- React Router for navigation
- Mantine UI for component library

## Key Features
- Event explorer with advanced filtering
- AI-powered error analysis using Ollama
- PostgreSQL deadlock analyzer
- Enhanced visualizations with D3.js
- Error boundaries and robust error handling

## Error Handling

The project has comprehensive error handling:
- Backend has global exception handlers
- Frontend uses ErrorBoundary components
- API error handling with proper feedback
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branches from main
2. Follow existing code patterns and architecture
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run lint and type checking before submitting PRs
5. Adhere to UI/UX guidelines for consistency

## Coding Guidelines

The following guidelines should be followed when working with this codebase:

### Core Principles
- **Enterprise-Grade Quality**: Prioritize stability, robustness, security, and maintainability in all code.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement thorough error handling at all potential failure points.
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Write clean, maintainable code following KISS, DRY and YAGNI principles.
- **Security-First Approach**: Follow secure coding practices and be vigilant about potential vulnerabilities.

### Implementation Requirements
- Always include proper type annotations in both TypeScript and Python code
- Ensure all API interactions have proper error handling with retries where appropriate
- Follow the existing error boundary pattern for React components
- Use the existing design system and UI components for consistency
- Write unit tests for new functionality and maintain test coverage

### Code Review Process
- Self-review code for correctness, robustness, and adherence to guidelines
- Verify that comprehensive error handling is implemented
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- Confirm that new code follows established patterns and architecture

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all non-trivial functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Follow existing testing patterns in the codebase
- Ensure tests are pure and deterministic
