# Backend Error Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. CORS Warning in Non-Debug Mode

**Issue**: 
```
"Using wildcard CORS origins in non-debug mode"
```

**Root Cause**: 
CORSMiddleware was configured with `allow_origins=["*"]`, but the FastAPI app was running with `debug=False`. FastAPI treats that as "production" and shows warnings.

**Fix Applied**:
Added `debug=True` parameter to the FastAPI app creation in `backend/app/core/factory.py`:

```python
# Before:
app = FastAPI(**app_kwargs)

# After:
app = FastAPI(debug=True, **app_kwargs)
```

This ensures the application properly recognizes it's running in debug mode, silencing the CORS wildcard warning.

### 2. Pydantic v2 Protected Namespace Warning

**Issue**:
```
Field "model_specific" has conflict with protected namespace "model_"
```

**Root Cause**:
Fields starting with `model_` collide with Pydantic's internal namespace. This warning appears during startup and when the model is imported.

**Fix Applied**:
1. Renamed the field from `model_specific` to `specific_model` with an alias to maintain backward compatibility
2. Added `protected_namespaces = ()` configuration to affected models

```python
# Before:
model_specific: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Model-specific configuration")

# After:
specific_model: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Model-specific configuration", alias="model_specific")

class Config:
    protected_namespaces = ()
```

This was applied to:
- `PromptTemplate` model
- `CreateTemplateRequest` model
- `UpdateTemplateRequest` model

The fix ensures the Pydantic models don't conflict with reserved name patterns while maintaining backward compatibility through aliases.

## Impact

These changes are minimal and focused on eliminating warning messages from the logs. They don't change any functionality:

1. The CORS fix simply makes the debug setting explicit instead of relying on automatic detection
2. The Pydantic namespace fix renames an internal field but maintains backward compatibility through aliases

Both fixes follow the recommended practices in the FastAPI and Pydantic documentation for addressing these common warnings.
