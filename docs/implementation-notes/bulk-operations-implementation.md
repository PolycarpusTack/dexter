# Bulk Operations Implementation Summary

## Date: May 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of bulk operations functionality in Dexter, which allows users to perform multiple operations on issues simultaneously.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Added Bulk Operations Endpoint** (`backend/app/routers/issues.py`):
   ```python
   @router.post("/issues/bulk", ...)
   ```
   - Accepts array of operations
   - Processes operations in parallel using async/gather
   - Returns detailed results for each operation

2. **Added Tag Support** (`backend/app/services/sentry_client.py`):
   ```python
   async def add_issue_tags(self, issue_id: str, tags: List[str])
   ```
   - Implements tagging through Sentry API
   - Includes mock data support

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Individual operation failures don't stop other operations
   - Detailed error information for each failed operation
   - Proper exception handling with meaningful messages

### Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced BulkActionBar Component** (`frontend/src/components/EventTable/BulkActionBar.tsx`):
   - Complete rewrite with full API integration
   - Modals for assignment and tagging
   - Real-time progress display
   - Proper error handling and notifications

2. **Created useBulkOperations Hook** (`frontend/src/hooks/useBulkOperations.ts`):
   - Manages bulk operation state
   - Provides convenience methods for common operations
   - Tracks progress in real-time
   - Handles API calls and error management

3. **Integration with EventTable**:
   - BulkActionBar already integrated in EnhancedEventTable
   - Selection state management exists
   - Checkbox column for multi-select

### Testing

1. **Backend Tests** (`backend/tests/test_bulk_operations.py`):
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Tests success cases, partial failures, invalid operations
   - Mock-based testing approach

2. **Frontend Test Component** (`frontend/src/components/TestBulkOperations.tsx`):
   - Interactive test component
   - Tests all operation types
   - Mixed operations support
   - Progress tracking demonstration

### Documentation

1. **API Documentation** (`docs/api/bulk-operations.md`):
   - Complete endpoint documentation
   - Usage examples for all operation types
   - Error handling guidance

2. **Implementation Notes**:
   - This document serves as implementation summary

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Operations processed concurrently for performance
   - Uses Python's asyncio.gather
   - Independent failure handling

2. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Real-time updates on operation progress
   - Granular success/failure counting
   - User-friendly feedback

3. **Error Resilience**:
   - Partial success is supported
   - Detailed error reporting
   - Operations continue despite individual failures

4. **User Experience**:
   - Modal dialogs for complex operations
   - Clear visual feedback
   - Intuitive bulk action interface

## Architecture Overview

```

## Operation Types Supported

1. **Status Updates**:
   - Resolve, unresolve, or ignore issues
   - Simple dropdown selection

2. **Assignment**:
   - Assign to user by email or ID
   - Modal interface for input

3. **Tagging**:
   - Add multiple tags at once
   - Multi-select with suggestions
   - Support for custom tags

## Integration Points

1. **Sentry API**:
   - Reuses existing methods for individual operations
   - Consistent error handling
   - Mock data support maintained

2. **Frontend State**:
   - Integrates with React Query
   - Automatic query invalidation
   - Consistent with single-operation patterns

3. **UI Components**:
   - Follows Mantine design patterns
   - Consistent with existing UI
   - Accessible and keyboard-friendly

## Performance Considerations

1. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Operations run concurrently
   - No blocking between operations
   - Efficient for large batches

2. **Progress Updates**:
   - Real-time feedback without polling
   - State-based progress tracking
   - Minimal re-renders

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors don't block other operations
   - Quick failure detection
   - Comprehensive error reporting

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add operation batching for very large sets
   - Implement request throttling
   - Add caching for common operations

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add operation history
   - Implement undo functionality
   - Add preset operation groups

3. **UI Improvements**:
   - Add drag-and-drop for bulk selection
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts
   - Add operation preview

4. **Integration**:
   - Add bulk operations to issue detail view
   - Integrate with search results
   - Add to context menus

## Notes

- Operations are limited by Sentry API rate limits
- Very large batches should be paginated
- Consider implementing operation queuing for better UX
- Progress tracking could be enhanced with WebSocket updates
