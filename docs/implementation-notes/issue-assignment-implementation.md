# Issue Assignment Implementation Summary

## Date: May 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of issue assignment functionality in Dexter, which allows users to assign Sentry issues to specific users.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Added Route** (`backend/app/routers/issues.py`):
   ```python
   @router.put("/issues/{issue_id}/assign", ...)
   ```
   - Accepts issue ID and assignment data
   - Uses dependency injection for SentryApiClient
   - Follows existing error handling patterns

2. **Added Model** (`backend/app/models/issues.py`):
   ```python
   class IssueAssignment(BaseModel):
       assignee: str = Field(..., description="User ID or email of the assignee")
   ```

3. **Added Service Method** (`backend/app/services/sentry_client.py`):
   ```python
   async def assign_issue(self, issue_id: str, assignee: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
   ```
   - Makes PUT request to Sentry API with `assignedTo` field
   - Includes mock data support for development
   - Proper error handling and logging

### Frontend Changes

1. **Updated API Client** (`frontend/src/api/issuesApi.ts`):
   - Fixed endpoint path from `/issue/` to `/issues/`
   - Maintained TypeScript types and interfaces

2. **Updated Path Mappings**:
   - Added `assignIssue` to `apiPaths.ts`
   - Updated `pathMappings.ts` with correct backend path
   - Removed unnecessary organization_slug parameter

3. **Enhanced API Client**:
   - Already had `assignIssue` method in `enhancedApiClient.ts`
   - Properly configured with path resolution

4. **Hook Integration**:
   - `useIssueActions` hook already supports assignment
   - Provides `assignTo` function with proper error handling

### Testing

1. **Backend Tests**:
   - Created comprehensive test suite in `test_issue_assignment.py`
   - Tests success case, not found, invalid assignee, validation errors

2. **Frontend Test Component**:
   - Created `TestAssignIssue.tsx` for manual testing
   - Provides UI to test assignment functionality

### Documentation

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/api/issue-assignment.md`
   - Includes endpoint details, usage examples, error handling

2. **Implementation Notes**:
   - This document serves as implementation summary

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Followed Existing Patterns**:
   - Used same error handling approach as other endpoints
   - Maintained consistency with existing API structure

2. **Simple Interface**:
   - Single endpoint with minimal parameters
   - Clear request/response structure

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling at all levels
   - User-friendly error messages

4. **Mock Data Support**:
   - Included mock data for development/testing
   - Follows existing mock data patterns

## Integration Points

1. **Sentry API**:
   - Uses PUT to `/api/0/issues/{id}/`
   - Sets `assignedTo` field in request body

2. **Frontend Components**:
   - Can be used in issue list, issue detail views
   - Integrates with existing notification system

3. **State Management**:
   - Invalidates queries after assignment
   - Updates UI automatically via React Query

## Next Steps

1. **UI Integration**:
   - Add assignment UI to EventTable component
   - Add assignment dropdown to issue detail view

2. **User Listing**:
   - Implement endpoint to list available assignees
   - Add user search/selection component

3. **Bulk Assignment**:
   - Extend bulk operations to include assignment
   - Add to bulk action menu

## Notes

- The Sentry API accepts both user IDs and email addresses for assignment
- Empty string unassigns the issue
- Rate limits may apply based on Sentry plan
- Assignment changes are reflected immediately in Sentry UI
