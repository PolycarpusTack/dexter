# Documentation Review Checklist

This checklist should be used during code reviews to ensure documentation is properly maintained alongside code changes.

## For all changes:

- [ ] Have you updated relevant documentation to reflect code changes?
- [ ] Are all API endpoints properly documented?
- [ ] Do architecture diagrams reflect the current system design?
- [ ] Has the implementation status document been updated?
- [ ] Have "Last Updated" dates been refreshed in modified documentation?
- [ ] Have you run the documentation validation tools?
- [ ] Are there any TODOs in the code that should be documented as future work?

## For API changes:

- [ ] API specification documentation updated
- [ ] Example requests and responses updated
- [ ] Error cases documented
- [ ] API validation script run successfully
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger specifications updated if applicable
- [ ] Postman collections updated if applicable

## For UI/UX changes:

- [ ] User interface documentation updated
- [ ] Screenshots/mockups replaced with current designs
- [ ] User workflow documentation updated if applicable
- [ ] Accessibility considerations documented

## For Architecture changes:

- [ ] Architecture diagrams updated
- [ ] Component relationships documented
- [ ] Design decisions and rationale documented
- [ ] Performance/scaling considerations documented

## For Bug fixes:

- [ ] Root cause documented
- [ ] Solution approach documented
- [ ] Testing strategy documented
- [ ] Prevention measures documented

## Documentation Quality:

- [ ] Documentation is clear and concise
- [ ] Technical terms are explained or linked to references
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with project standards
- [ ] Links to other documentation are working

## How to use this checklist:

1. Copy this checklist into your PR description
2. Check off items as you complete them
3. Remove items that are not applicable to your change
4. Leave unchecked items as TODOs if they need to be addressed later
5. Reviewers should verify documentation changes as part of the review
