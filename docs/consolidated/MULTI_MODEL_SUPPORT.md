# Multi-Model Support Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of Multi-Model Support (Task 4.2) for the Dexter project. This feature enhances the AI-powered error explanations by supporting multiple AI models with model-specific prompting strategies and a fallback chain for improved reliability.

## Design Principles

1. **Model Registry System**: A centralized registry for managing multiple AI models across providers
2. **Model-Specific Prompting**: Optimize prompts based on each model's strengths
3. **Fallback Chain**: Graceful degradation when preferred models are unavailable
4. **Provider Abstraction**: Support for multiple LLM providers beyond Ollama
5. **User Preferences**: Allow users to configure model preferences

## Implementation Components

### 1. Backend Components

#### Model Registry
- Create a `ModelRegistry` class to manage models from multiple providers
- Store model metadata (size, capabilities, parameters)
- Track model availability and status

#### Provider Adapters
- Create abstract `LLMProvider` interface
- Implement provider-specific adapters (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.)
- Handle different API patterns and error responses

#### Enhanced LLM Service
- Support for multiple active models
- Model-specific prompt templates
- Fallback chain logic
- User-specific model preferences

### 2. Frontend Components

#### Enhanced Model Selector
- Support for model categories and providers
- Model comparison and details view
- Fallback chain configuration
- Provider-specific settings

#### Model Dashboard
- Model performance metrics
- Usage statistics
- Comparison tools for model outputs

### 3. API Enhancements

#### Model Management
- Extended APIs for model registry operations
- Model configuration endpoints
- Model performance tracking

#### User Preferences
- APIs for storing and retrieving user model preferences
- Session-based model selection

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Create model registry and provider interface
2. Implement enhanced Ollama provider
3. Update LLM service to support multiple models
4. Update backend APIs for model management

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI
1. Enhance ModelSelector component
2. Add fallback chain configuration UI
3. Create model performance dashboard
4. Implement model comparison tools

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Connect enhanced components
2. Add model-specific prompt templates
3. Implement user preferences
4. Add telemetry for model performance

## Features

### Model Registry
- Support for multiple model providers
- Model metadata and capabilities
- Health status monitoring
- Version tracking and updates

### Model Selection
- Primary/fallback model selection
- Provider-specific configuration
- Model comparisons
- Performance metrics

### Fallback Chain
- Configurable fallback sequence
- Automatic retry with fallback models
- Error-specific model selection
- Performance-based automatic routing

### Multi-Provider Support
- Consistent interface across providers
- Provider-specific optimizations
- Credential management
- Rate limiting and usage tracking

## Migration Path

1. Keep backwards compatibility with current approach
2. Add new functionality alongside existing code
3. Gradually transition components to use new system
4. Deprecate old API once transition is complete
