# Deadlock Analyzer Documentation

## Overview

The Deadlock Analyzer is a key component of the Dexter system that detects, visualizes, and provides recommendations for resolving deadlock issues in monitored applications. This document consolidates multiple documents related to the Deadlock Analyzer feature.

## Implementation Details

The Deadlock Analyzer consists of the following key components:

1. **Detection Engine**: Analyzes event data to identify potential deadlock patterns
2. **Visualization Components**: Renders deadlock graphs and dependency relationships
3. **Recommendation System**: Suggests potential fixes based on detected issues
4. **Modal Interface**: Provides detailed analysis and interactive exploration

### Core Files

- `components/DeadlockDisplay/DeadlockDisplay.tsx` - Main display component
- `components/DeadlockDisplay/DeadlockModal.tsx` - Modal for detailed analysis
- `components/DeadlockDisplay/EnhancedGraphView.tsx` - Advanced visualization
- `components/DeadlockDisplay/RecommendationPanel.tsx` - Fix recommendations
- `api/deadlockApi.ts` - API integration for deadlock data

## Component Architecture

The Deadlock Analyzer follows a modular architecture:

```
DeadlockDisplay
├── DeadlockModal
│   ├── EnhancedGraphView
│   ├── TableInfo
│   └── RecommendationPanel
└── DeadlockSummary
```

### Component Responsibilities

- **DeadlockDisplay**: Entry point for the feature, handles initial rendering and state
- **DeadlockModal**: Detailed analysis view with multiple tabs and advanced options
- **EnhancedGraphView**: Interactive visualization of deadlock relationships
- **TableInfo**: Tabular representation of deadlock data
- **RecommendationPanel**: AI-powered recommendations for resolving deadlocks

## User Interface

The Deadlock Analyzer provides a multi-layered user interface:

1. **Summary View**: Initial compact representation in the event table
2. **Modal View**: Expanded analysis with tabs for different perspectives
3. **Interactive Graph**: Visual representation with zoom, pan, and node selection

### UI Components

#### Summary View

The summary appears in the event table as a button with basic deadlock indicators:

```typescript
// Example component structure
<DeadlockSummary>
  <DeadlockIcon severity={deadlock.severity} />
  <DeadlockCount count={deadlock.locksCount} />
  <ViewDetailsButton onClick={openModal} />
</DeadlockSummary>
```

#### Modal View

The modal provides comprehensive analysis with multiple tabs:

1. **Graph View**: Visual representation of locks and dependencies
2. **Table View**: Detailed tabular data for all locks
3. **Timeline**: Chronological sequence of lock acquisition
4. **Recommendations**: Suggested fixes for the detected issues

## Visualization

The Deadlock Analyzer uses D3.js for advanced graph visualization:

1. **Node Representation**: Processes, threads, and resources as nodes
2. **Edge Representation**: Lock acquisition and waiting relationships
3. **Color Coding**: Visual indicators for lock states and severity
4. **Interactive Elements**: Zoom, pan, select, and explore

### Visualization Technique

The graph is rendered using a force-directed layout algorithm:

```typescript
// Example D3 implementation snippet
function createForceLayout(nodes, links) {
  return d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
    .force('link', d3.forceLink(links).id(d => d.id).distance(100))
    .force('charge', d3.forceManyBody().strength(-300))
    .force('center', d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
    .on('tick', ticked);
}
```

## Recommendation Engine

The recommendation engine analyzes deadlock patterns and suggests potential solutions:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common deadlock patterns
2. **Code Analysis**: Examines call stacks and lock acquisition patterns
3. **Solution Database**: Matches patterns to known solutions
4. **Ranking System**: Prioritizes recommendations by effectiveness

### Example Recommendations

- Reordering lock acquisition to follow a consistent hierarchy
- Using try-locks with timeout to prevent indefinite waiting
- Refactoring to eliminate nested lock acquisition
- Implementing deadlock detection and recovery mechanisms

## Integration Points

The Deadlock Analyzer integrates with several other Dexter components:

1. **Event System**: Receives deadlock event data
2. **Issue Tracking**: Links deadlocks to related issues
3. **Alert System**: Generates notifications for critical deadlocks
4. **API Layer**: Fetches additional context and metadata

### Data Flow

```
Sentry Events → API Client → Deadlock Detection → Visualization → Recommendations
```

## Development Guide

### Adding New Features

To extend the Deadlock Analyzer:

1. **New Visualization Types**: 
   - Add implementations to `EnhancedGraphView.tsx`
   - Register in the visualization selector

2. **Additional Recommendations**:
   - Add patterns to `deadlockPatterns.ts`
   - Implement solution templates in `recommendationTemplates.ts`

3. **Enhanced Detection**:
   - Extend the detection algorithm in `deadlockDetection.ts`
   - Update the scoring system in `severityCalculator.ts`

### Component Customization

The analyzer supports customization via theme options:

```typescript
// Example theme customization
const theme = {
  deadlock: {
    colors: {
      node: {
        process: '#6E9CF5',
        thread: '#4CAF50',
        resource: '#FF5722',
      },
      edge: {
        acquired: '#4CAF50',
        waiting: '#FF5722',
        potential: '#FFC107',
      },
    },
    // Additional theme options
  },
};
```

## Testing Strategy

The Deadlock Analyzer includes comprehensive testing:

1. **Unit Tests**: 
   - Component rendering
   - Graph algorithm correctness
   - Recommendation logic

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - End-to-end deadlock detection
   - API data processing
   - UI interaction flows

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Large graph rendering
   - Complex deadlock pattern detection
   - UI responsiveness under load

### Test Data

The tests use a combination of:

- Mock data fixtures with predefined patterns
- Randomized graph generators for stress testing
- Real-world derived samples for accuracy validation
