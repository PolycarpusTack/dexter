# Dexter API Optimization Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the API optimization project for Dexter. The goal was to standardize and enhance the Sentry API integration while maintaining backward compatibility and adding new critical features.

## Key Achievements

1. **Unified API Configuration System**
   - Created YAML-based configuration for all API endpoints
   - Established a single source of truth for both backend and frontend
   - Implemented robust path resolution with parameter validation

2. **Enhanced Sentry API Client**
   - Built a comprehensive client with complete API coverage
   - Added caching, error handling, and rate limiting
   - Implemented request optimization techniques

3. **Real-time Capabilities**
   - Added WebSocket support for live updates
   - Implemented efficient polling for older browsers
   - Created subscription mechanism for event notifications

4. **Extended Functionality**
   - Added support for bulk operations and batching
   - Implemented Discover API integration
   - Added alert rules management
   - Created issue assignment and collaboration features

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented multi-level caching strategy
   - Added request deduplication and concurrency control
   - Optimized response parsing and transformation

6. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Added circuit breaker pattern for API protection
   - Implemented retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Created graceful degradation for partial outages
