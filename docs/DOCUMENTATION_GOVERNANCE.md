# Documentation Governance for Dexter

This document outlines the governance model for Dexter's documentation to ensure it remains accurate, up-to-date, and valuable throughout the project lifecycle.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Documentation Owner
- Responsible for overall documentation strategy and quality
- Final approval for major documentation changes
- Quarterly review of documentation accuracy and completeness
- Ensuring documentation tools and processes are maintained

### Module Owners
- Maintain documentation for specific modules or components
- Review documentation PRs related to their modules
- Ensure documentation is updated alongside code changes
- Report documentation issues to the Documentation Owner

### All Team Members
- Update documentation when making code changes
- Follow documentation standards and templates
- Report documentation inconsistencies or gaps
- Participate in documentation reviews as needed

## Review Schedule

| Frequency | Activity | Owner | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Weekly | Quick Review | Module Owners | Quick check of any documentation changes related to the week's work |
| Bi-weekly | Status Update | Documentation Owner | Update implementation status document |
| Monthly | Module Review | Module Owners | Full documentation audit focusing on one module per month |
| Quarterly | Full Review | Documentation Owner | Complete documentation review and planning |

## Documentation Lifecycle

1. **Creation**
   - Documentation created alongside feature development
   - Use templates from `docs/templates/`
   - Include implementation status section

2. **Review**
   - Documentation reviewed by module owner
   - Technical accuracy verified
   - Adherence to standards checked

3. **Publication**
   - Documentation merged into main branch
   - Added to appropriate section in docs
   - Indexed in navigation if applicable

4. **Maintenance**
   - Regular updates based on review schedule
   - "Last Updated" date maintained
   - Implementation status kept current

5. **Archival**
   - Outdated documentation marked as deprecated
   - Moved to archive section if necessary
   - References updated to point to current docs

## Documentation Standards

### General Guidelines

- All documentation should be written in Markdown
- Use proper Markdown syntax and formatting
- Include "Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD" at the end of each document
- Include implementation status where applicable
- Use relative links to reference other documentation files
- Keep line length reasonable (100-120 characters maximum)
- Use sentence case for headings

### API Documentation

- All API endpoints must be documented using the template
- Include examples for requests and responses
- Document error responses and status codes
- Include authentication requirements
- Keep synchronized with actual API implementation

### Architecture Documentation

- Include diagrams using Mermaid.js syntax
- Clearly explain component relationships
- Document design decisions and alternatives considered
- Keep system diagrams updated as architecture evolves

### Code Documentation

- Use docstrings in code (Python, TypeScript)
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Reference documentation files where appropriate
- Include example usage for public APIs

## Documentation Tooling

### Validation Tools

The project includes documentation validation tools in the `docs/tools/` directory:

- `validate_docs.py`: Validates API endpoints against documentation
- `generate_status.py`: Generates documentation status dashboard
- `extract_api_docs.py`: Extracts API docs from OpenAPI specs

### Usage

```bash
# Validate documentation
python docs/tools/validate_docs.py

# Generate status dashboard
python docs/tools/generate_status.py

# Extract API documentation
python docs/tools/extract_api_docs.py
```

### CI/CD Integration

Documentation validation is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

- Documentation is validated on every PR
- Status dashboard is generated nightly
- API documentation is extracted when API specs change

## Documentation Improvement Process

### Identifying Issues

Documentation issues can be identified through:

- Regular reviews
- User feedback
- Validation tools
- Developer experience issues

### Creating Documentation Tasks

1. Create an issue with the "documentation" label
2. Include specific details about what needs to be improved
3. Link to related code or existing documentation
4. Assign to appropriate module owner

### Measuring Improvement

Documentation health is measured through:

- Documentation coverage (% of API endpoints documented)
- Freshness (% of docs updated in last 90 days)
- Completeness (implementation status tracking)
- Validation errors and warnings

## Getting Started with Documentation

### For New Team Members

1. Read this governance document
2. Review the templates in `docs/templates/`
3. Check the current documentation status in `docs/status/`
4. Follow the existing documentation patterns

### For Module Owners

1. Set up regular documentation review cadence
2. Ensure team members know documentation expectations
3. Validate documentation as part of PR reviews
4. Report documentation issues to Documentation Owner

## Conclusion

Effective documentation is critical to Dexter's success. By following these governance guidelines, we ensure our documentation remains a valuable asset for development, onboarding, and knowledge sharing.
