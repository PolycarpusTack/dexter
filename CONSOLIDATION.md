# Dexter TypeScript Consolidation

## Overview

This document describes the consolidation of state management and theme files in the Dexter project. The goal was to eliminate duplicate files (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`) and ensure all components use the TypeScript (`.ts`) versions exclusively.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management Store

- Enhanced `appStore.ts` with features from both `appStore.js` and `appStore.jsx`
- Added missing features:
  - `latestEventsByIssue` record to track the latest event per issue
  - `storeLatestEventId` method for updating latest events
  - `resetFilters` method for resetting filters
  - `setConfig` method for compatibility with old code
  - `clearSelection` method for clearing issue/event selection
- Added compatibility methods to handle different property naming conventions
- Removed the old JavaScript files:
  - `appStore.js`
  - `appStore.jsx`

### 2. Theme Configuration

- Enhanced `theme.ts` with features from `theme.js`
- Added background color definitions:
  - `background: colors.neutral[50]`
  - `surface: 'white'`
  - `border: colors.neutral[300]`
- Ensured proper TypeScript typing using `MantineThemeOverride`
- Removed the old JavaScript file:
  - `theme.js`

### 3. Import References

- Updated all import statements to use the TypeScript versions without file extensions
- Property mappings updated to use the new names:
  - `issueStatusFilter` → `statusFilter`
  - `issueSearchTerm` → `searchQuery`
  - `setIssueStatusFilter` → `setStatusFilter`
  - `setIssueSearchTerm` → `setSearchQuery`

## Backup

All original files have been backed up to the `backup` directory:

- `backup/store/appStore.js`
- `backup/store/appStore.jsx`
- `backup/theme/theme.js`

## Verification

The following verification steps were performed to ensure a successful consolidation:

1. Checked all components use the correct import paths (no file extensions)
2. Verified all old property names have been updated
3. Confirmed the consolidated TypeScript files include all required features
4. Ensured the old JavaScript files have been removed

## Next Steps

1. Run the application to verify everything works as expected
2. Consider further TypeScript improvements:
   - Enable stricter type checking
   - Migrate more files from JavaScript to TypeScript
   - Add more type definitions

## Utilities Created

Several utility scripts were created to help with the consolidation:

- `verify-imports.js` - Checks for problematic imports with extensions
- `check-property-mappings.js` - Finds usage of old property names
- `update-property-names.js` - Updates property names in components
- `verify-consolidation.js` - Final verification of the consolidation

These scripts can be used for future migration tasks if needed.
