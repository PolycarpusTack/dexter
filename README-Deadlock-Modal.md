# Deadlock Analyzer Modal Implementation

This enhancement transforms the existing Deadlock Analyzer into a modal-based interface, providing more screen real estate for complex visualizations and a more focused analysis experience.

## Overview

The Deadlock Analyzer Modal provides a dedicated, full-screen capable view for analyzing PostgreSQL deadlocks with the following features:

1. **Enhanced Visualization Space**: More room for complex graph visualizations, table lock information, and timeline views
2. **Tab-Based Navigation**: Clean separation between different visualization types
3. **Modal Controls**: Full-screen toggle, data masking, and export capabilities
4. **Enhanced Security**: Data masking for sensitive information
5. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive user interaction tracking for analytics and compliance
6. **Error Boundaries**: Component-level error isolation for improved stability

## Implementation Details

### New Components

1. **DeadlockModal.jsx**: The main modal component that houses the visualization tabs
2. **DeadlockColumn.jsx**: Table column component that renders a button to open the deadlock modal
3. **EventRow.jsx**: Row component for the event table, including the deadlock button for relevant events

### New Hooks

1. **useClipboard.js**: Enhanced clipboard operations with fallbacks and error handling
2. **useDataMasking.js**: PII/sensitive data masking with configurable patterns
3. **useAuditLog.js**: User interaction tracking for analytics and compliance

### Updated Components

1. **EnhancedEventTable.jsx**: Updated to use the new EventRow component and DeadlockColumn
2. **EventsPage.jsx**: Added to demonstrate the integration in a page context

## How to Test the Implementation

1. Navigate to the Events page (`/events`)
2. Select a project that contains PostgreSQL deadlock events (error code 40P01)
3. Look for events with a "Analyze Deadlock" button in the Analysis column
4. Click the button to open the Deadlock Analyzer Modal
5. Test the following features:
   - Switching between Graph View, Lock Details, and Recommendations tabs
   - Toggle Enhanced Analysis on/off to compare results
   - Toggle Mask Sensitive Data to see PII protection in action
   - Toggle Full Screen mode for expanded visualization space
   - Use the Copy to Clipboard button for recommendations
   - Export SVG of the visualization
   - Show/hide raw deadlock data

## Key Features

### Visualization Tabs

- **Graph View**: Interactive visualization of deadlock processes and their relationships
- **Lock Details**: Tabular view of tables, processes, and lock types involved
- **Recommendations**: AI-powered suggestions for resolving the deadlock

### Modal Controls

- **Enhanced Analysis**: Toggle between standard and enhanced analysis algorithms
- **Data Masking**: Toggle PII/sensitive data masking
- **Full Screen**: Expand the modal for maximum visualization space
- **Refresh**: Re-run the analysis with current settings
- **Export**: Save the graph visualization as SVG

### Error Handling

- Component-level error boundaries prevent a failure in one visualization from affecting others
- Clear error messages and retry options for each visualization type

## Code Structure and Patterns

### Component Organization

- Each visualization type is in its own component, wrapped with an error boundary
- The modal is the orchestration layer that manages state and data flow
- Clear separation between data fetching, visualization, and user interaction

### Custom Hooks

- Reusable logic is extracted into custom hooks for better modularity
- Each hook has a single responsibility (clipboard, data masking, audit logging)
- Hooks follow React best practices for dependencies and cleanup

### Data Flow

1. EnhancedEventTable renders EventRow components
2. EventRow renders DeadlockColumn for deadlock events
3. DeadlockColumn renders a button that opens DeadlockModal
4. DeadlockModal fetches analysis data and renders visualization tabs
5. Each tab component renders a specific visualization type

## Future Enhancements

1. **Virtualized Lists**: For handling large datasets in table views
2. **Progressive Rendering**: For complex graphs with many nodes
3. **Collaborative Annotations**: Allow multiple users to add notes to the analysis
4. **Export Options**: Additional export formats (PNG, PDF) and sharing capabilities
5. **A11y Improvements**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for visualizations
