# Keyboard Navigation Implementation

## Overview

Dexter now features comprehensive keyboard navigation across the application, providing enhanced accessibility and efficiency for all users. This document provides an overview of the implementation details and usage guidelines.

## Key Features

- **Arrow key navigation** for table rows and list items
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for common actions
- **Visual focus indicators** for all interactive elements
- **Screen reader support** with proper ARIA attributes
- **Skip links** for improved navigation
- **Keyboard shortcut guide** accessible via the `?` key

## Implementation Details

### Components Enhanced

1. **EnhancedEventTable**
   - Arrow key navigation for event rows
   - Enter key to view selected event
   - Home/End keys to jump to first/last event
   - Visual indicator for selected row

2. **DeadlockModal**
   - Keyboard controls for zoom, pan, and layout
   - Focus trapping within modal
   - Accessible controls for all features

3. **Global Application**
   - Shortcuts for navigation between sections
   - Search focus via the `/` key
   - Help dialog via the `?` key
   - Refresh via `Ctrl+R` / `âŒ˜+R`

### Custom Hooks

The implementation uses several custom hooks:

1. **useKeyboardNavigation**
   - Base hook for keyboard navigation patterns
   - Handles focus management and navigation logic

2. **useEventTableKeyboardNav**
   - Specific hook for event table navigation
   - Manages selected row and keyboard interactions

### Accessibility Considerations

The implementation follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:

- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality is operable through a keyboard interface
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: Keyboard focus is never trapped in any component
- **2.4.3 Focus Order**: Components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning
- **2.4.7 Focus Visible**: All keyboard operable user interface has a visible focus indicator

## User Experience

The keyboard navigation significantly improves user experience:

- **Speed**: Power users can navigate faster without switching to mouse
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader users can navigate effectively
- **Consistency**: Navigation patterns are consistent across the application
- **Discoverability**: Keyboard shortcuts are discoverable via the help dialog

## Testing

The keyboard navigation implementation has been tested for:

- Complete keyboard operability
- Screen reader compatibility (NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Visual focus indicators in all themes
- Performance impact (minimal)
- Browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for keyboard navigation:

1. User-configurable keyboard shortcuts
2. Improved multi-select capabilities
3. Enhanced form field navigation
4. Additional power user shortcuts for advanced operations

## Usage Guidelines

See the [Keyboard Shortcuts Guide](./frontend/src/docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) for detailed information on available shortcuts and navigation patterns.
