# Gradual Adoption Strategy for the New Dexter Architecture

This document outlines a phased approach for gradually adopting the new consolidated architecture for Dexter.

## Phase 1: Parallel Operation (Current Phase)

During this phase, both the old and new architectures coexist, with the old directly calling into the new.

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks

### Key Components:
1. **Compatibility Layer**: The `app/core/compatibility.py` module provides backward compatibility.
2. **Shim Files**: The original `main_*.py` files are now shims that redirect to the new architecture.
3. **Deprecation Warnings**: Warnings notify developers about the upcoming changes.

### Developer Actions:
- Start using `APP_MODE` environment variable instead of different main files
- Review new YAML configuration files and customize as needed
- Run tests with both old and new approaches to verify equivalence

## Phase 2: New Features on New Architecture

During this phase, new features are implemented using the new architecture, while existing features maintain backward compatibility.

**Duration**: 4-8 weeks

### Key Components:
1. **New Routers**: Implement new routers using the new patterns
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Use the new logging system for better diagnostics
3. **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: Use YAML files for configuration

### Developer Actions:
- Implement new features using the new patterns
- Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
- Create tests that specifically target the new architecture

## Phase 3: Gradual Migration of Existing Features

During this phase, existing features are gradually migrated to fully embrace the new architecture.

**Duration**: 4-8 weeks

### Key Components:
1. **Router Migrations**: Update existing routers to use the new patterns
2. **Service Refactoring**: Refactor services to leverage the new architecture
3. **Test Coverage**: Enhance test coverage during migration

### Developer Actions:
- Refactor one router or service at a time
- Update tests to verify functionality
- Document changes in patterns

## Phase 4: Complete Migration and Cleanup

During this phase, the migration is completed, and backward compatibility layers are removed.

**Duration**: 2-4 weeks

### Key Components:
1. **Remove Shims**: Delete the shim files
2. **Remove Compatibility Layer**: Remove the compatibility module
3. **Update Documentation**: Finalize all documentation

### Developer Actions:
- Remove deprecated code
- Update all documentation to reflect only the new architecture
- Ensure all tests pass with the new architecture

## Communication Plan

### Regular Updates:
- Weekly announcement about migration progress
- Documentation updates as features migrate
- Dedicated channel/tag for migration questions

### Training:
- Short tutorial on using the new architecture
- Code review sessions focused on the new patterns
- Pair programming for complex migrations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Missing configuration**: Check YAML files and environment variables
2. **Import errors**: Ensure compatibility with new import patterns
3. **Middleware issues**: Verify middleware ordering and configuration

### Support Channels:
- Dedicated Slack channel for migration questions
- GitHub issues tagged with "migration"
- Regular office hours for migration support

## Success Metrics

1. **Code reduction**: Measure reduction in duplicated code
2. **Bug reduction**: Track bugs in new architecture vs. old
3. **Developer satisfaction**: Survey on new architecture usability
4. **Build/startup time**: Measure improvements in application startup

## Rollback Plan

If significant issues are discovered, a rollback plan is available:
1. Revert main files to their original state
2. Remove new architecture files
3. Update documentation to reflect rollback

However, the backward compatibility approach makes this unlikely to be necessary.
