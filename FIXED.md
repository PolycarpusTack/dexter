# React Error Fixes

I've implemented the specific fixes for the React errors:

## 1. Fixed ReactDOM createRoot import

The main issue was with how ReactDOM was being imported from 'react-dom/client'. The module has no default export, so importing it as a default export fails.

Fixed in `src/main.tsx`:
```ts
// âœ… CORRECT: Import the named export directly
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Then use it directly
const root = createRoot(rootElement);
root.render(<App />);
```

## 2. Fixed React version consistency

Added npm overrides to ensure only one React version is used:

```json
"overrides": {
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "18.2.0"
}
```

## 3. Added "require is not defined" fix

Added minimal polyfills in index.html:
```html
<script>
  // Minimal polyfills to fix "require is not defined" error
  window.require = function() { return {}; };
  window.process = { env: { NODE_ENV: 'development' } };
  window.global = window;
  window.module = { exports: {} };
</script>
```

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run the clean installation script I've provided:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ./clean-install.sh
   ```

2. After the clean install, start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The script will:
- Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
- Install the exact versions of React
- Reinstall all dependencies
- Verify that only one version of React is in the dependency tree

This should completely resolve both the `createRoot is not a function` and `require is not defined` errors.
